# PRJ_Boston_Housing_ML

In this project, I will be evaluating prices of houses in suburbs of Boston by using Machine Learning. Machine learning is achieved using Python 3. Model used for evaluating results is Decision Tree Regressor. 

MACHINE LEARNING - Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.

Decision Tree - Regression. Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

At time of developing this program following version of packages/libraries is used.
1. Python       version 3.7.1
2. scikit-learn version 0.20.1
3. numpy        version 1.15.4
4. pandas       version 0.23.4
5. matplotlib   version 3.0.2

This is required & correct information upto my knowledge.
